However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children.To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection.This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison.Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions.The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection.In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7\\%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4\\%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6\\%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95\\% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1\\%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1\\%, and 347 (4.0\\%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3\\%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95\\% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0\\%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course.The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.}",

Data were collected from emergency and inpatient encounters for children (aged \\&lt;18 years) from 2010 to 2019: 3 049 699 in the development (including derivation and internal validation) set and 581 317 in the external validation set.Stacked regression models to predict mortality in children with suspected infection were derived and validated using the best-performing organ dysfunction subscores from 8 existing scores. The final model was then translated into an integer-based score used to establish binary criteria for sepsis and septic shock.The primary outcome for all analyses was in-hospital mortality. Model- and integer-based score performance measures included the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC; primary) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC; secondary). For binary criteria, primary performance measures were positive predictive value and sensitivity.Among the 172 984 children with suspected infection in the first 24 hours (development set; 1.2\\% mortality), a 4-organ-system model performed best. The integer version of that model, the Phoenix Sepsis Score, had AUPRCs of 0.23 to 0.38 (95\\% CI range, 0.20-0.39) and AUROCs of 0.71 to 0.92 (95\\% CI range, 0.70-0.92) to predict mortality in the validation sets. Using a Phoenix Sepsis Score of 2 points or higher in children with suspected infection as criteria for sepsis and sepsis plus 1 or more cardiovascular point as criteria for septic shock resulted in a higher positive predictive value and higher or similar sensitivity compared with the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) criteria across differently resourced settings.The novel Phoenix sepsis criteria, which were derived and validated using data from higher- and lower-resource settings, had improved performance for the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis and septic shock compared with the existing IPSCC criteria.}",

In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but it excluded children.To update and evaluate criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children.The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a task force of 35 pediatric experts in critical care, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, general pediatrics, nursing, public health, and neonatology from 6 continents. Using evidence from an international survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and a new organ dysfunction score developed based on more than 3 million electronic health record encounters from 10 sites on 4 continents, a modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop criteria.Based on survey data, most pediatric clinicians used sepsis to refer to infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction, which differed from prior pediatric sepsis criteria that used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which have poor predictive properties, and included the redundant term, severe sepsis. The SCCM task force recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Children with a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points had in-hospital mortality of 7.1\\% in higher-resource settings and 28.5\\% in lower-resource settings, more than 8 times that of children with suspected infection not meeting these criteria. Mortality was higher in children who had organ dysfunction in at least 1 of 4—respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological—organ systems that was not the primary site of infection. Septic shock was defined as children with sepsis who had cardiovascular dysfunction, indicated by at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which included severe hypotension for age, blood lactate exceeding 5 mmol/L, or need for vasoactive medication. Children with septic shock had an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.8\\% and 33.5\\% in higher- and lower-resource settings, respectively.The Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were derived and validated by the international SCCM Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force using a large international database and survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and modified Delphi consensus approach. A Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 identified potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction in children younger than 18 years with infection, and its use has the potential to improve clinical care, epidemiological assessment, and research in pediatric sepsis and septic shock around the world.}",

For example, the Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry is a multi-institutional national database that utilizes real-world health care data to inform best practices, improve patient outcomes, and test hypotheses that require large data samples. However, many challenges arise when capturing patient-level details/data from the health records especially when this data must be aggregated across multiple institutions. Here, we describe a pipeline that (1)pulls large-scale data from the EHRs, (2)wrangles and remaps the data in a format appropriate for the database using R statistical software, and (3)imports the data in bulk for thousands of patients at a time into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), the electronic data capture system that houses the data. The EHR-R-REDCap pipeline can be utilized to capture many patient data features from the participating institutions. Here, we demonstrate eLAB, the EHR-R-REDCap pipeline utilized by our Merkel Cell Carcinoma Patient Registry to capture thousands of laboratory values from the EHR for thousands of patients. We provide source code, examples, and instructions for adaptability for other clinical research projects that aim to collect large-scale laboratory data from the EHR.To develop a clinical informatics pipeline designed to capture large-scale structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for a national patient registry.The EHR-R-REDCap pipeline is implemented using R statistical software to remap and import structured EHR data into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-based multi-institutional Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) Patient Registry using an adaptable data dictionary.Clinical laboratory data were extracted from EPIC Clarity across several participating institutions. Laboratory values (Labs) were transformed, remapped, and imported into the MCC registry using the EHR labs abstraction (eLAB) pipeline. Forty-nine clinical tests encompassing 482 450 results were imported into the registry for 1109 enrolled MCC patients. Data-quality assessment revealed highly accurate, valid labs. Univariate modeling was performed for labs at baseline on overall survival (N = 176) using this clinical informatics pipeline.We demonstrate feasibility of the facile eLAB workflow. EHR data are successfully transformed and bulk-loaded/imported into a REDCap-based national registry to execute real-world data analysis and interoperability.}",

    abstract = "{Contrary to clinical trials, which are designed to collect data for research purposes in a harmonized manner, real-world data are typically generated for administrative (eg, health insurance claims for billing purposes) or clinical documentation (eg, electronic health records) purposes. Hence, confounders and prognostic factors, which need to be balanced between treatment groups to infer causal treatment effects, are often unavailable for all patients at all necessary time points, resulting in missing data. It is important to investigate potential missingness patterns and mechanisms to determine if assumptions for common analytic methods such as complete case analysis or imputations hold to avoid bias in resulting treatment effect estimates. Here, we present the smdi R package, which enables researchers to conduct such principled missing data investigations on partially observed confounders. The smdi package implements functions to visualize and describe missing data and to infer potential missingness patterns and mechanisms based on observed data.Partially observed confounder data pose a major challenge in statistical analyses aimed to inform causal inference using electronic health records (EHRs). While analytic approaches such as imputation are available, assumptions on underlying missingness patterns and mechanisms must be verified. We aimed to develop a toolkit to streamline missing data diagnostics to guide choice of analytic approaches based on meeting necessary assumptions.We developed the smdi (structural missing data investigations) R package based on results of a previous simulation study which considered structural assumptions of common missing data mechanisms in EHR.smdi enables users to run principled missing data investigations on partially observed confounders and implement functions to visualize, describe, and infer potential missingness patterns and mechanisms based on observed data.The smdi R package is freely available on CRAN and can provide valuable insights into underlying missingness patterns and mechanisms and thereby help improve the robustness of real-world evidence studies.}",
